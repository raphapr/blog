I live in Florian√≥polis, SC, Brazil. I work at [Linx+Neemu+Chaordic](https://www.chaordic.com.br/) as cloud engineer, on cloud team. I'm a passionate about GNU/Linux and Open Source and call me a dreamer but I believe that developers have the power to build a better future.

My email is raphaelpr01@gmail.com and you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelpr/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/raphapr).
